[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/24ayr5ou5cux26ui/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/akatakritos/pygmentsharp/branch/master)

A port of python's [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighter.

Aims to follow the overall approach (for now) while still being mostly
idiomatic c#.

Roadmap:

I need the following features from Pygment for my static blog generator.
Other features can be ported by the community as needed.

- [x] HTML Output
- [x] C# Highlighting
- [ ] HTML Highlighting
- [ ] XML Highlighting
- [ ] Shell script highlighting
- [ ] Ruby Highlighting
